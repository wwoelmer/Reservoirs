We calculated the daily discharge rate of water in cubic meters per second entering Falling Creek Reservoir through the gauged weir on its primary inflow. We measured the amount of water entering into the reservoir through the weir with an INW Aquistar PT2X pressure sensor (INW, Kirkland, Washington, USA), which recorded the weir water level with a pressure sensor and stream temperature every 15 minutes. The water level data were then used to calculate the daily flow rate of water entering into the reservoir, following Gerling et al. (2014).The weir installed at the inflow is rectangular, and thus very low flows are often not well-resolved by our flow equation and. At these times, flow is reported as NA. However, the Falling Creek Reservoir inflow stream does have perennial flow. References:Gerling, A. B., R. G. Browne, P. A. Gantzer, M. H. Mobley, J. C. Little, and C. C. Carey. 2014.
