Discharge rates and water temperature of the primary inflow tributary into Falling Creek Reservoir (Vinton, Virginia, USA) were measured at a gauged weir on a 15-minute temporal resolution from 2013 to 2018.

The dataset consists of discharge rates calculated from a pressure transducer in the rectangular weir and water temperatures measured at the same site.
