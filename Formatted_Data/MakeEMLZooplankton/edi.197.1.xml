    <abstract>
      <para>
  Crustacean zooplankton density and biomass and rotifer density were
  measured from 2014 to 2016 in four drinking water reservoirs in
  southwestern Virginia, USA. These reservoirs are: Beaverdam Reservoir
  (Vinton, Virginia), Carvins Cove Reservoir (Roanoke, Virginia),
  Gatewood Reservoir (Pulaski, Virginia), and Spring Hollow Reservoir
  (Salem, Virginia). Beaverdam, Carvins Cove and Spring Hollow
  Reservoirs are owned and operated by the Western Virginia Water
  Authority as primary or secondary drinking water sources for Roanoke,
  Virginia, and Gatewood Reservoir is a drinking water source for the
  Town of Pulaski, Virginia. The dataset consists of both integrated
  vertical tow samples from the whole water column, just the epilimnion,
  and just the hypolimnion (as the difference between the full water
  column and epilimnion tows), as well as discrete depth measurements
  collected with a Schindler trap. All samples were collected at the
  deepest site of each reservoir adjacent to the dam. The samples were
  collected approximately fortnightly in the spring, summer, and autumn
  months and there are also data from 24-hour sampling campaigns.

        <description>
          <para>
  Crustacean zooplankton and rotifers were collected at the deepest
  location in each reservoir, close to the dam (coordinates: BVR: 37.313
  degrees N, 79.816 degrees W; CCR: 37.371 degrees N, 79.958 degrees W;
  GWR: 37.043 degrees N, 80.862 degrees W; SHR: 37.231 degrees N, 80.176
  degrees W). Zooplankton were collected by 74-micron mesh vertical tow
  nets (Wildlife Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) approximately
  fortnightly during the thermally stratified period in 2014-2016 in
  BVR, CCR, and GWR, and 2014-2015 in SHR. In 2014 and 2015 in BVR, CCR,
  and GWR, tow nets were lowered to approximately 0.5 m above the bottom
  lake sediments and pulled up to the surface at a constant speed to
  collect zooplankton from the full water column. In SHR, zooplankton
  were only collected from 25-30 m deep to the surface to avoid
  substantial net catch efficiency issues. In 2016, in addition to the
  full water column tows in BVR, CCR, and GWR, a second vertical tow was
  also taken from either 1) the thermocline depth to the nearest meter
  determined from either a CTD or YSI profile collected at the same
  time, or the oxycline depth rounded to the nearest meter determined
  from the CTD or YSI. The second tow was collected in 2016 in these
  reservoirs to determine zooplankton present in the epilimnion vs. the
  hypolimnion when the reservoirs were fully oxic, or in the oxic vs.
  hypoxic parts of the water column in reservoirs experiencing
  hypolimnetic hypoxia.
</para>
          <para>
  In 2016, we also performed 24-hour sampling campaigns to examine the
  effects of hypolimnetic oxygen concentrations on zooplankton diel
  vertical migration. Therefore, in addition to vertical tow samples, we
  also collected 30-L Schindler trap samples. Schindler traps (Wildlife
  Supply Company, Yulee, Florida, USA) were collected during these
  sampling events (as well as vertical tows) at noon, dusk, midnight,
  2AM, dawn, and noon the following day. The 24-hour sampling campaigns
  were conducted on 7-8 June and 3-4 August in BVR, 27-28 May and 12-13
  August in CCR, and 29-30 April, 26-27 June, and 4-5 September in GWR.
  Schindler trap samples were collected at each meter in the water
  column from 0.1 m to a meter just below the thermocline or the
  oxycline. On the second BVR 24-hour sampling event, we sampled each
  meter in the water column with the Schindler trap. Zooplankton samples
  for both vertical net tow and Schindler traps were preserved in 70
  percent ethanol.
</para>
          <para>
  Zooplankton were identified using a Meiji RZ dissecting microscope
  (Meiji Techno, San Jose, California, USA) at 50x magnification.
  Because of the large quantity of samples collected, crustacean
  zooplankton and rotifers were identified predominantly to the genus
  level. Daphnia were identified to the species level and cyclopoids
  were identified to the order level. At least 100 crustacean
  zooplankton and 100 rotifers were counted for each sample, or until
  three replicates of each sample were counted. Densities were
  calculated by scaling counts per subsample to the volume of the
  vertical net tows from the water column or from the Schindler traps
  (Downing and Rigler, 1984). All large crustacean zooplankton
  (Leptodora sp. and Chaoborus sp.) were counted in each sample and then
  scaled to the volume of the vertical tow net or the volume of the
  Schindler trap. The first ten individual crustacean zooplankton taxa
  in each sample were measured and biomass was calculated using
  published length-weight regressions (Dumont and Balvay, 1979; Downing
  and Rigler, 1984). Biomass was not calculated for rotifers. If the
  taxon is not listed for a reservoir on a sampling date, that means
  that the density, and therefore, its biomass, was 0. Chaoborus and
  Leptodora were largely only counted for density, not biomass,
  estimates in 2014 and 2015.
</para>
          <para>
  Length-weight regression estimates used to calculate biomass, using
  ln(a) is the y-intercept and b is the slope. Estimates are summarized
  in Downing and Rigler (1984). Bosmina: ln(a)=2.7116, b=2.5294;
  Ceriodaphnia: ln(a)=2.5623, b = 3.3380; Chydorus: ln(a) = 4.543, b =
  3.636; Daphnia: ln(a) = 1.54, b = 2.29; Diaphanosoma: ln(a) = 1.2894,
  b = 3.039; Cyclopoids: ln(a) = 2.2266, b = 3.230; Diaptomus: ln(a) =
  1.05, b = 2.46; Leptodora: ln(a) = -0.8220, b = 2.670; Chaoborus:
  ln(a) = -2.183, b = 3.2345
